# week-4

# FNB IT Varisty work
# Learning Javascript

# At one point durng my revision, I thought it a wnderful idea to populate my css stylesheet
# While working on it, I had only the switch.html browser open
# It is only afterwards that I realised that upon populating the stylesheet, it affected all other files in the code
# Caution: when you notice that the style format does not make sense to other files, it wasn't meant for them
# I had a lot of fun this lesson, playing around with the functions, removing what works and what didn't
# I hope to return to this in the future and correct my styling issue
# As of now, I submit this work, as a wokrinh progress.
